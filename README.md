# IP Sweeper

## Objective

The primary objective of this script is to provide a lightweight and efficient method for network administrators and cybersecurity professionals to quickly identify active devices within a given IP range. This tool can be helpful in network monitoring, troubleshooting, and security assessments to ensure that all expected devices are accounted for and any unknown or unexpected devices are promptly identified.

### Skills Learned

- **Bash Scripting:** Developed proficiency in writing and executing bash scripts to automate network tasks.
- **Networking Fundamentals:** Gained a deeper understanding of IP addressing and the mechanics of ICMP (ping) requests and responses.
- **Network Scanning:** Learned techniques for efficiently scanning a range of IP addresses and identifying active hosts within a network.
- **Linux Command Line:** Enhanced skills using various Linux command-line tools, including ping, grep, and other text-processing utilities.
- **File Handling:** Practiced file handling in bash, such as writing output to text files and managing script logs.
- **Problem Solving:** Applied logical reasoning to handle edge cases, such as filtering out non-responsive IPs and managing large IP ranges.

### Tools Used

- **Bash:** The primary scripting language used to automate the IP sweeping process.
- **grep:** A command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines that match a regular expression, used to filter ping results.
- **tr:** A command for translating or deleting characters.
- **cat:** This allows me to create single or multiple files, view the file containing it, concatenate the files, and redirect output to the terminal or files.
- **cut**: Used to extract sections from each line of input - usually from a file.
- **echo:** Used within the script to output text and results to the terminal and files.
